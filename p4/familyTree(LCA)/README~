Given generations of families, and two queries. Find their least common ancestor.

Algorithm:
1.Stored into a hash table, with our hash function using the first 4 letters of a person's last name and first name. We used bitshifted left in our hash function to reduce arthmetic operations and improve it's performance.
2.Store the two queries and their parent's into two queues
3.Call qsort to sort by year
4.Pop off queues and compare
5.Store in answers array
